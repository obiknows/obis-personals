### Background

This is about food. Or what we consider "food" today. (Technically speaking these are food products)

I think starch only exists in unnatural foods. 

Actually... lemme run that back.
I *know* (b/c Obi Knows™️) that starch is an unnatural polymer that gums up your system
and robs you of your Iodine.

### Hypothesis

Iodine is a necessary supplement for proper Thyroid function so that would mean that
**starch is bad for your thyroid** [see here](https://www.google.com/search?q=iodine+and+thyroid+function&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS754US754&oq=iodine+and+th&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.4126j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)


### Experiement

Dont believe me?

Lets test it out.
<!-- Lets test some natural ones and some that I aren't as natural for the presence of starch. -->

How so?

With Iodine and Starch course! 
[see the test on Youtube](https://youtu.be/CWVQWcbtsmA)

<!-- YOUTUBE STARCH TEST -->
{{< youtube id="CWVQWcbtsmA" class="hugo-youtube-embed" >}}


### Results 

COOL RIGHT?

So what happens is the Starch meets with the available Iodine and forms a complex like the one
picture below

When this happens the Iodine is trapped by the Starch coil and this new molecue is responsible
for the blue/black color that forms in the test tube.

In our bodies, the same thing happens, except that now instead of the Iodine going to our Thyroid like it should, it is sequestered in the Starch which creates a whole host of complications along the line.

### Conclusion

Peace and Power
