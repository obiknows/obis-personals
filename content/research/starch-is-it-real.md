This is about food. Or what we consider "food" today. (Technically speaking these are food products)

I think starch only exists in unnatural foods. 

Actually... lemme run that back.
I *know* (b/c Obi Knows™️) that starch is

 Lets test some natural ones and some that I aren't as natural for the presence of starch.


 How so?


 With Iodine of course! see a quick test [here](https://youtu.be/SgDeHXWm8Hk?t=17s)


### Experiment Todos

```
1. design an experiment to show the presence of starch in unnatural foods / products
2. gather the necessary materials and equipments
3. film and perform the test, taking necessary measurements
4. analysis
5. present the findings
```

and hopefully by the end of this, you'll know a little more about starch, some backstory, as well as steps you can take to remove this mucus causing polymer from your diet.
