This is about food.

I think starch only exists in unnatural foods. Lets test some natureal ones and some that I believe aren't as natural for the presence of starch


TODOS

```
1. design an experiment to show the presence of starch in unnatural foods / products
2. gather the necessary materials and equipments
3. film and perform the test, taking necessary measurements
4. analysis
5. present the findings
```

and hopefully by the end of this, you'll know a little more about starch, some backstory, as well as steps you can take to remove this mucus causing polymer from your diet.

Peace and Power
