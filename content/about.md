Yo, whats good,  I'm Obi. Short for Obinna.

 I'm a hacker, I'm a healer, I make music, and I'm a serial entrepreneur, farmer, and budding filmmaker.

I got a lot of interests, so its kinda hard for me to sit still. So I made this site to showcase a few and get some thoughts off my head.

Enjoy and Feel Free to contact me [here](https://contact.obiknows.co) or send an email to 
[**obiknows88@gmail.com**](mailto:obiknows88@gmail.com?subject=Whats%20good%20Obi) if you
got some business you think we should speak about.







Oh yeah, I gotta thank [Vicky Lai](https://vickylai.io) for this site design.
