Yo, whats good,  I'm Obi. Short for Obinna.

 I'm a healer, I'm a hacker, I make music, and I'm a serial entrepreneur, investor and farmer.

I got a lot of interests, so its kinda hard for me to sit still. So I made this site to showcase a few and get some thought off my head.




I gotta thank [Vicky Lai](https://vickylai.io) for this design.
