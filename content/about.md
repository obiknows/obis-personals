Yo, whats good,  I'm Obi. I'm a .... I'm a hacker, producer, and serial entrpreneur and investor.

I have slick minimalist templates for list pages (such as a list of blog posts) and single pages (a page to read one blog post). You can use tags on your content, and view content by tags.

I also have a simple responsive gallery built with CSS grid. It'll look great on any screen, and all you have to do is provide a folder of images.

I gotta thank [Vicky Lai](https://vickylai.io) for this design.
